## What is a design system?

A design system is a set of UI standards, documentation and reusable components that help teams design and develop separate features while maintaining a cohesive appearance and experience. 

### What is Booster?

Booster is a modern and responsive front-end framework based on Zywave's established design standards. It's the living domain of our visual language that serves as our guide to creating first-rate partner solutions with ease. Booster is custom-made by our Zywave team to fit our specific needs; it's not a definitive guide on development, design, or documentation.

### How does Booster aid your workflow?

Save time by using Booster as a quick reference for styles, whether you're a new or established team member.

#### Communication

Communicate with other team members using shared vocabulary, foundations, interactivity, and more.

#### Consistency

Employ and maintain consistency when only referencing one place to quickly see if designs, documentation, and more deviate from our established styles.
