## What is it & what does it do?

It is a broader term that many of Zywave's visual, front end, and design related standards and tooling are filed under. ZUI, Zywave's reusable component library, (for more info, see below) is part of the Booster Design System.

### What is ZUI?

The Zywave User Interface (ZUI) is a modern and responsive front-end framework based on Zywave's established design standards. It's the living domain of our visual language that serves as our guide to creating first-rate partner solutions with ease. ZUI is custom-made by our Zywave team to fit our specific needs; it's not a definitive guide on development, design, or documentation.

### How does ZUI aid your workflow

#### Time

Save time by using ZUI as a quick reference for styles, whether you're a new or established team member.

#### Communication

Communicate with other team members using ZUI shared vocabulary, foundations, interactivity, and more.

#### Consistency

Employ and maintain consistency when only referencing one place to quickly see if designs, documentation, and more deviate from our established styles.
