## Usage

Progress bars inform users about the status of ongoing processes, the estimated time of how long a process will take, or if a request is being executed.



## Anatomy

1. **Bar:** The visual element that represents progress. It fills up horizontally as the task progresses.
2. **Label/Percentage:** A numeric indicator, typically displayed above or within the progress bar, showing the completion percentage.
3. **Container:** The enclosing element that holds the progress bar and related information.
