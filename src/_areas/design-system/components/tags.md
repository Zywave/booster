## **Usage**

Tags are labelled objects designed to stand out for the purpose of easy categorization.

They are often seen in the context of lists and tables in order to highlight certain differences between their contents. Using Tags in a table draws attention to specific pieces of information.

1. **Container:** the container of the Tag
2. **Label:** the text signifying the explicit meaning of the Tag

## **Placement**

Tags are usually placed right next to the name of whatever they are categorizing, or they are placed in a distinct column in the context of a table.

There should typically be 10px of spacing between a tag and other elements, including other tags.

If there are multiple tags being used, they should ideally be organized in one row unless there isnâ€™t enough space.

## **Behavior**

Tags are static objects that should not be used an interactive elements.
