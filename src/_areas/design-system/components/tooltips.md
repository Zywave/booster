## Usage

Tooltips are user-triggered messages that help provide additional information to the page element during the user's workflow. It is usually activated by a mouse-hover action or keyboard-hover action. 

* Tooltips can be paired with any page element, such as icons, buttons, texts etc.
* These messages should not be critical for the user to read and there should be no action included within them.
* Tooltips trigger on hover and remain active until the user is no longer hovering over that page element. A 200ms dissolve transition fades tooltips on and off the page.

Avoid placing actionable items on the Tooltip messages, such as buttons or link texts. Users will not be able to interact with these items because the message will disappear as users move the mouse away from the page elements.

Ensure Tooltips do not block related page content. This will disturb users' workflow and cause repetitive actions (close Tooltips to view page element, hover and see Tooltips again, then close Tooltips and interact on the page).

### Additional guidlines

* Use a tooltip when a UI element has little or no descriptive text label but uses may need a brief explaination to understand how to interact.
* Always make sure that the Tooltip arrow is pointing at the related page content and is centered on the tooltip message
* Use colors on page elements to call out for attention
* Keep Tooltips short and concise. In certain scenarios, this text may flow onto a second line within the tooltip. However, if the text is too complex or an action needs to be taken, you may need to consider a different delivery option for this information.
