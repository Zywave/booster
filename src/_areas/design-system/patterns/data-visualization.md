## Usage

Data visuals are designed to make it easy to compare data and use it to tell a story – both of which can help users in decision-making. This allows users to digest, visualize and see trends in their data.

## Principles

The data visualization process always begins with a set of data, a question, and an analysis of the data to find the answer. Each visualization should focus on answering a single question about the dataset. For example, “What are my sales over time?”

Data visualizations should be approached by:

#### Solving a problem

Have a clear question that needs to be answered. If multiple answers to multiple questions are illustrated in a single visualization, it will become over complicated and hard to understand. If one graph is too complex to represent a certain dataset, the data should be represented in multiple, simple graphs.

#### Simplicity

Keep the visual elements as simple as possible. Only necessary information such as labels, values, and bars or lines should be present. A key or legend should be provided for more complex data that may have multiple colors or types of information. Colors and other visual elements should always be kept to a minimum when possible.

#### Designing with real data

Designing with real data will reveal the effectiveness of the visualization. Also test when there are a few data points (one or two) or many data points (100 or more). Adapt data visualizations for different device sizes, while anticipating user needs on data depth and complexity

## Types

The following are the basic types of data visualizations. For detailed documentation on Data visualization, view the `Data visualization design specs.`

Booster supports`vertical column`, `line`, `vertical bar`, `display`, `pie`, `donut `and `heatmap `charts.

When choosing a chart type, consider your data set and what you want to convey about the data.
