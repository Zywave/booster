## Usage

![Empty states usage](/images/emptystate_usage.svg)

A useful empty state will let the user know what’s happening, why it’s happening, and what to do about it.

They are most commonly seen the first time a user interacts with a product or page but can also be encountered when data has been deleted or is unavailable.

## Anatomy

![Empty states anatomy](/images/emptystate_anatomy.svg)

1. **Illustration (optional):** The illustration is used to give the user more insight into what will be available on the page when data has been added or is available. For detailed documentation on our illustrations, view [Booster Illustrations](https://booster.zywave.dev/design-system/visuals/illustrations/ "https\://booster.zywave.dev/design-system/visuals/illustrations/").
2. **Title (optional):** The title gives the user an understanding of the message or decision they are being presented with. Ideally, the title should not span more than one line.
3. **Body:** The body provides supporting content for the title and gives guidance to the user on what next steps to take. The body text should be kept straightforward and span no longer than three lines.
4. **Action (optional):** An action associated with the message. This action should be the next step the user will take on the page or in the workflow that presented the empty state.

## Layout & structure

The layout and structure of any empty state is determined by application and component context.

#### Cards

Cards are a very common component for holding empty states. Use a hero or spot illustration based on your use case.
