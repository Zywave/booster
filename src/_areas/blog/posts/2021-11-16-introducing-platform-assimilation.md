## Introduction

The Platform Assimilation team is a newly created team designed to aid in the onboarding of Zywave acquisitions. 

The team will be responsible for defining and identifying Zywave platform standardization maturity, and will guide teams as they navigate their transition into a mature Zywave application. 

## Platform Standardization Maturity Model

Over the years, Zywave has rapidly transformed from a set of disconnected products with separate logins into a more unified offering, where our customers are buying Zywave instead of a hodge-podge of point solutions. Features like Zywave Authentication, Zywave Shell, Licensing, and Access Control have helped prepare our applications for a larger unification. It is now up to our applications to utilize these tools to improve the experience of all Zywave users.

The platform [standardization maturity matrix](https://booster.zywave.dev/platform-standardization-form/) spans four different categories, each having three different stages.

* Authentication and Authorization

* User Experience and Design

* Data, API’s, and Business Intelligence

* Infrastructure and Security

The stages in each of the categories indicate varying degrees of standardization maturity as defined in the model.  A solution can be in any stage across any category. It's a very likely state to be Stage 3 in one category, and Stage 1 in another.

Defining the standardization model is a work in progress that spans multiple teams. Expect to see regular revisions.

## First Impressions and Future Plans

The platform assimilation team met with the Mod Master team to gather feedback regarding the first draft of the standardization maturity model which resulted in some great feedback. The Agency Matrix team will be getting a demonstration this week with more teams to follow as we refine the process.

In the long term, all teams will be required to assess where each product falls on the standardization maturity model. The intention is to have teams self-assess by evaluating each category stage and checking whether or not they apply. We will initially be using the Booster site to facilitate the collection of this data, but this is subject to change. 

The platform assimilation team will curate a list of applications, determine where those applications fall on the standardization maturity model, and prioritize a backlog of stories to enable teams to achieve maximum Zywave standardization maturity. 

## Fielding Platform Questions

We encourage teams experiencing platform related problems to reach out via the Platform Assimilation Teams channel, and we will do our best to assist. We will be paying close attention to questions directed at DevSecOps, DevKit, and Auth Systems teams so that we can triage and troubleshoot issues.
