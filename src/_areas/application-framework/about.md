## What is it and what does it do?

The Application Framework (commonly referred to as the Zywave API Toolkit) is a collection of API-driven custom elements that help enforce not just the consistency of the design of a single component on a page, but the overarching consistent of data, navigation, and interaction. 

Commonly, this collection of components will have heavy dependency on our [design system](/design-system/about/) and help engineers create applications that fit snuggly into the Zywave value proposition. 

## How does the Application Framework aid you?

1. Greatly reduces time to build an application that feels like a part of the "one Zywave" philosophy.
2. Continual enhancements allow you to focus on what matters to your features while getting new features without lifting a finger.
3. End users get a common experience and increases visibility into what your application can offer them.
