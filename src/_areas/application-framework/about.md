## What is it and what does it do?

The Application Framework (commonly referred to as the Zywave API Toolkit) is a collection of API-driven custom elements that help enforce consistency of:

* data and how it is presented
* navigation through the Zywave ecosystem
* interaction with Zywave platform componentry, such as support, profiles, etc.

This collection of components will have heavy dependency on our [design system](/design-system/about/) to assist engineers in creating applications that fit snuggly into the Zywave value proposition. 

## How does the Application Framework assist you?

1. Greatly reduces time to build an application that feels like a part of the "one Zywave" philosophy.
2. Continual enhancements mean getting new features without lifting a finger to allow you to focus on what matters to your features.
3. End users get a consistent experience and increased visibility into what your application can offer them.
