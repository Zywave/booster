## Using the Booster Development Network components

You may follow the design standards and UI/UX best practices in this documentation site when building your applications. Design specs are included for most of our components if you'd like to create them from scratch, but we highly recommend using our custom elements because you will get continual enhancements without having to make changes on your end. We aim to simplify and streamline the process of building UIs by offering framework-agnostic custom elements that we ensure will follow Zywave's design standards, including mobile responsiveness. These custom elements are part of two major sections that make up the Booster Development Network: design system and application framework.

## Booster Design System

If you're looking for design guidance or components to build your user interfaces, look no further! We have **over 30 UI components** with extensive API and design documentation, as well as live demos with code snippets, to make incorporating Booster Design System into your applications effortless.

## Booster Application Framework

Looking to integrate your applications into the Zywave suite? The Booster Application Framework provides a collection of API-driven components and tools to help you quickly build Zywave-integrated applications. It greatly reduces the time to build applications by making your applications look and feel like "one Zywave" application. One catch to using these components is your applications **must support Zywave Auth**.
