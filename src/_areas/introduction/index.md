## What is the Design System?

TheÂ **Booster Design System**â€”previously called Zywave User Interface (ZUI)â€”is your go-to for all front-end and design standards. It embodies our visual language and serves as a guide to creating top-notch partner solutions with ease. Custom-made by our Zywave team, ZUI is tailored to fit our specific needs, providing a quick reference for styles, shared vocabulary, foundations, interactivity, and more.

#### How does Booster Design System aid your workflow?

* **Time**: Save time by using Booster as a quick reference for styles, whether you're a new or established team member.
* **Communication**: Enhance communication with team members using Booster's shared vocabulary and foundations.
* **Consistency**: Maintain consistency by referencing one place to ensure designs, documentation, and more align with our established styles.

## What is the application framework?

TheÂ **Booster Application Framework**, commonly referred to as the Zywave API Toolkit (ZAPI), is a powerful suite of API-driven custom elements. It ensures consistency in:

* How data is served and presented
* Navigation throughout the Zywave ecosystem
* Interaction with Zywave platform components, such as support, profiles, and more

This collection of components heavily relies on our design system to assist engineers in creating applications that seamlessly fit into the Zywave value proposition.

#### How does the Application Framework assist you?

* **Efficiency**: Greatly reduces the time to build an application that feels like a part of the "one Zywave" philosophy.
* **Enhancements**: Continual enhancements mean getting new features without lifting a finger, allowing you to focus on what matters most.
* **User Experience**: End users get a consistent experience and increased visibility into what your application can offer them.

#### What requirements are there to use these components?

The APIs underlying these components are built to Zywave's standards and support Zywave-authenticated users. Applications consuming these components must comply with the same Zywave standards and authentication. All components can be provided a bearer token for authentication purposes or used in conjunction with the [Zywave API proxy](https://booster.zywave.dev/application-framework/components/api-proxy/?tab=usage). If not consuming the proxy, relevant scopes must be authorized. These scopes are illustrated on each component's Usage section where applicable.

For an overview of the APIs currently exposed that these components could communicate with, check out theÂ [**API documentation site**.](https://www.zywave.dev/apis/)

## Which one do I use?

While any project can use the Booster Design System, there are requirements that need to be met in order to use the Booster Application System.
