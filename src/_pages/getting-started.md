## Format docs with custom elements

To maintain consistency, we've created custom elements for patterns that are commonly used throughout the docs.

### Do and do not

Best practices for using components are often called out in two categories: do and do not. Use these custom elements to help convey good and bad practices.

<docs-do>
Recommended best practices go here.
You can provide your own HTML markup to format if you have more than one best practice to share.
</docs-do>
